# About

My name is Georgi Georgiev and I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University, studying Computer Vision. My current topics of interest are open-world recognition and related topics such as active learning, co-segmentation, incremental learning and scalable learning. 

In addition to computer vision, I am a YouTube/Twitch viewer, video game player, Ganondorf main, and many other things. I like reading from various media sources, such as books, manga/manhua/comics/webtoons/, Twitter, Reddit, and more. You will probably see many references to those interests in the blog and I apologize in advance. 

I have cycled through various social media and I am currently most active on Twitter. You can [follow](https://twitter.com/mewopean) my rants and drivel (R&D) as well as some actual research talk.
