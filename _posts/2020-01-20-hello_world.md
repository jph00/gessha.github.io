## Why blog again?

Hello and welcome to my blog. This is not the first time I'm making one but I hope this time it will stay for longer. Personal websites and blogs have been hard for me to make because I focus too much on the details and when I get stuck on something, it causes me to stop blogging or writing altogether. I've learned ways to cope with this as I've grown but it's still a demon of mine which I'm trying to overcome. 

## Recent motivation

One reason I decided to start blogging again is I saw [Jeremy Howard's](https://twitter.com/jeremyphoward/status/1218965132849496064?s=20)  where he showed a very easy way to start blogging. Last time I tried hosting my blog on GitHub Pages, it took me several hours to install and google through all the details and I was still not persistent enought to finish it due to a few fights with Ruby. Five minutes after reading Jeremy's post, I am writing this post which should be up by the end of the day. He and [Rachel Thomas]() from [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) make a great case for blogging in their respective blogs. Rachel's post on why you should start blogging can be found [here](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045).

Another reason for blogging is that it helps you clarify your thoughts and helps you learn writing and whatever you're writing about much better. I want to get better at what I am studying and practicing and this will be part of my path to profficiency.

## Who am I and what do I do

My name is Georgi Georgiev and I am a PhD student at Stony Brook University, studying Computer Vision. My current topics of interest are open-world recognition and related topics such as active learning, co-segmentation, incremental learning and scalable learning. 

In addition to computer vision, I am a YouTube/Twitch viewer, video game player, Ganondorf main, and many other things. I like reading from various media sources, such as books, manga/manhua/comics/webtoons/, Twitter, Reddit, and more. You will probably see many references to those interests in the blog and I apologize in advance. 

I have cycled through various social media and I am currently most active on Twitter. You can [follow](https://twitter.com/mewopean) my rants and drivel (R&D) as well as some actual research talk.
