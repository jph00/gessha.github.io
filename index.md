# Georgi's blog

Hello and welcome to my blog. This is not the first time I'm making one but I hope this time it will stay for longer. Personal websites and blogs have been hard for me to make because I focus too much on the details and when I get stuck on something, it causes me to stop blogging or writing altogether. I've learned ways to cope with this as I've grown but it's still a demon of mine which I'm trying to overcome.
